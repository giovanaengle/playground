params:
  format: torchscript # Target format for the exported model, such as 'onnx', 'torchscript', 'engine' (TensorRT), or others. Each format enables compatibility with different deployment environments.
  imgsz: 640 # Desired image size for the model input. Can be an integer for square images (e.g., 640 for 640Ã—640) or a tuple (height, width) for specific dimensions.
  keras: False # Enables export to Keras format for TensorFlow SavedModel, providing compatibility with TensorFlow serving and APIs.
  optimize: False # Applies optimization for mobile devices when exporting to TorchScript, potentially reducing model size and improving inference performance. Not compatible with NCNN format or CUDA devices.
  half: False # Enables FP16 (half-precision) quantization, reducing model size and potentially speeding up inference on supported hardware. Not compatible with INT8 quantization or CPU-only exports for ONNX.
  int8: False # Activates INT8 quantization, further compressing the model and speeding up inference with minimal accuracy loss, primarily for edge devices. When used with TensorRT, performs post-training quantization (PTQ).
  dynamic: False # Allows dynamic input sizes for ONNX, TensorRT and OpenVINO exports, enhancing flexibility in handling varying image dimensions. Automatically set to True when using TensorRT with INT8.
  simplify: True # Simplifies the model graph for ONNX exports with onnxslim, potentially improving performance and compatibility with inference engines.
  opset: null # Specifies the ONNX opset version for compatibility with different ONNX parsers and runtimes. If not set, uses the latest supported version.
  workspace: null # Sets the maximum workspace size in GiB for TensorRT optimizations, balancing memory usage and performance. Use None for auto-allocation by TensorRT up to device maximum.
  nms: False # Adds Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to the exported model when supported (see Export Formats), improving detection post-processing efficiency. Not available for end2end models.
  batch: 1 # Specifies export model batch inference size or the maximum number of images the exported model will process concurrently in predict mode. For Edge TPU exports, this is automatically set to 1.
  device: mps # Specifies the device for exporting: GPU (device=0), CPU (device=cpu), MPS for Apple silicon (device=mps) or DLA for NVIDIA Jetson (device=dla:0 or device=dla:1). TensorRT exports automatically use GPU.
  fraction: 1 #.0 Specifies the fraction of the dataset to use for INT8 quantization calibration. Allows for calibrating on a subset of the full dataset, useful for experiments or when resources are limited. If not specified with INT8 enabled, the full dataset will be used.
